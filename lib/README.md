# Lib directory

This directory contains libraries (files & packages) that meet one or more of the following criteria:

* are not coupled to any particular application in the project,
* are not distributed by any acceptable packaging format
* are distributed in an acceptable packaging format, but are not publicly available for download (ex: there is no public-facing PyPI server that contains such package)
